# CryptArithmetic-Problem-using-Constraint-Satisfaction-Algorithm

The variables in our constraint-satisfaction problem are the different alphabets. 

The domains are numbers from 0 to 9.

The constraints are no two alphabet can represent same digit and check the mathematics.

This is the CryptArithmetic problem. The constraints are that the each alphabets should have differnt numbers from 0 to 9. For doing this we have first defined the CSP algorithm in which we have defined the variables, Domains and constraints. Using Backtrack search algorithm we are satidfying the constraints. And then we have defined our CryptArithmetic problem and defined variables, domains and the constraints for this problem. Then we are also looking for consistency and all.
